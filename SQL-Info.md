<h2>Difference between MySQL and SQL</h2>
- SQL is a Structured Query Language. It is useful to manage relational databases. <br>
- MySQL is an RDBMS to store, retrieve, modify and administrate a database using SQL. <br>

<h2>RDBMS</h2>
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System <br>
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. <br>
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entriess and it consists of columns and rows. <br>

Every table is broken up int smaller entities called fields. The fileds in e.g. a Customer tables can consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to mmaintain specific information about every record in the table. <br>

A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in our example Customer table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table. <br>

A column is a vertical entity in a table taht contains all information associated with a specific field in a table. <br>
